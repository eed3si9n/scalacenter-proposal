This is a repo to track ideas to propose to Scala Center.

Scala Center is an independent not-for-profit center established at EPFL to guide and support the Scala community,
develop open source libraries and tools for all Scala users, and to provide education for Scala.

Please be mindful that the resource is finite, so if you can work on something at your own free time or
your work can sponsor your time at work, that would be more sustainable.
If there are something specific you think Scala Center can help that would benefit the wider Scala community,
please open a discussion.
